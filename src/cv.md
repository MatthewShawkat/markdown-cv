## Profile
I'm a passionate and dedicated web developer, with an interest in self-development and learning new things. My aim is to create robust and high quality systems, which are aesthetically pleasing and provide usable interfaces. I'm very flexible and adaptable to new technologies, which I enjoy experimenting with. I like to work on interesting challenges, and I am currently looking to join a dynamic and ambitious team.

## Work

#### May 2014 - Sep 2014
##### Front End Developer - Tquila
I worked with a Scrum team developing a web framework that provides offline capabilities to the Salesforce platform. The framework is built on HTML5 and AngularJS; it runs on a desktop browser, as well as mobile phones as a hybrid app using Cordova. Some of the work I did included:

- Structured the AngularJS app in a modular way, with asynchronous module loading (ADM) implemented in RequireJS. Also, I decoupled the core functionality of the automatic syncing and offline storage, by implementing it in native JavaScript, using CoffeScript to avoid common JavaScript pitfalls, and achieve code readability.
- Introduced Ionic Framework that provides a mobile first user interface, with full AngularJS integration. I integrated the SASS pre-processor to provide power and modularity in terms of generating style sheets.
- Used IndexedDB and WebSQL to store data on the browser while offline, and synchronise automatically when back online. In addition, I used Underscore to write robust and clean code.
- Set up Grunt to orchestrate the build process and provide one click deployments. The process compiles CoffeeScript and Sass, lints the code, runs the Karma tests, then minifies and copies the assets to the build directory. Documentation is auto generated from the source code.
- Used Bower to manage third party dependencies, alongside internal library dependencies by converting them to bower packages.
- Utilised Git for source control, and implemented a collaboration mechanism similar to the open source community, using Bitbucket.

#### Oct 2013 - May 2014
##### Freelance Web Developer - HexoLab
I have been working with multiple clients on a wide range of projects. I work simultaneously on these projects and adopt a lean methodology, where I would go through multiple iterations with clients. Some of the projects include:

- **Imkei App:** an HTML5 mobile payment app, which uses SMS and Email to facilitate payments for freelancers. I created the app by integrating with GoCardLess (payment gateway), and having a Django backend that interfaces with their API.
- **TrueUp:** redesigning the company website. The project involved creating a responsive Wordpress theme from scratch. I used Foundation Framework to provide the basis of a clean and modern interface. For styling, I used Sass to modularise the CSS and save time.
- **MallorcaPlus App:** an HTML5 app, for selling excursions in Mallorca. The front end utilises AngularJS to provide modularity. The app integrates with PayPal for receiving payments, and the Django backend has an admin area for ticket and event management. The interface is multilingual with English, Spanish and German.

#### Jul 2012 - Aug 2013
##### Application Developer - Goldman Sachs
I worked in a fast paced development environment to create and support applications for traders. Projects usually involved working with multiple teams in different countries. Some of my work included:

- Introducing automated building to applications developed by my team. I used Maven to manage dependencies, run tests and handle packaging, and Jenkins for continuous integration and build monitoring. This change shortened the deployment cycle from two weeks to a few minutes.
- Updating the UI for some applications to use XAML. I used this opportunity to undertake UX research to find out how to improve the interface. Using the results of the research, I redesigned the layout and added some design patterns, such as grids and modals.
- Developing a matching engine to reconcile feeds received from third party companies with the data stored in the company database. I added an algorithm to detect the nearest match if an exact match is not found. This helped traders find mismatch issues more efficiently.

#### Jun 2011 - Sep 2011
##### Web Developer - Sysaro Systems
I worked with a small team on a highly specialised management system for housing associations. The project involved replacing a desktop app with a modern web app, providing a SaaS platform for clients. Some of my work included:

- Creating the strategy for the front end of the web app. I designed and implemented a modular JavaScript app that is decoupled from the back end. This allowed the front end to be easily rewritten for a mobile app.
- Using JQuery to add interactive elements and Ajax requests to enable a single page experience providing a more ‘app-like’ look and feel.
- Creating wireframes and high fidelity mock-ups to test some ideas. I went through iterations of small prototypes before development, avoiding the trap of committing to a design that does not match the clients’ expectations.

#### Jun 2010 - JUN 2011
##### Application Developer (Placement) - Goldman Sachs
I worked with a core technical team developing libraries and infrastructure for other teams. Some of my work included:

- Writing a widget for an in-house web portal that aggregates feedback for research documents from multiple sources, filtering them according to specified rules and presenting them in the same format.
- Developed a blackberry app with push capability to provide sales people with news and relevant information. The data is transferred and persisted on the device memory automatically, allowing for offline viewing. The app had to overcome connectivity issues, such as lost signals and corrupted data, in order to run continuously.

## Learning & Education
##### Tech Events:
I enjoy attending hackathons and meet-ups, such as, -AngularJS London- and -London Web-, to keep up to date with new technologies, and learn new techniques.
 
##### Professional Scrum Master Certification - Scrum.Org
I'm able to execute the scrum methodology for product development, and organise and teach teams to follow it.

#### 2008 - 2012
##### University of Manchester  - Computer Science with Industrial Experience - First Class
I studied the basics of programming and diverse aspects of computing. Among the courses I studied, I particularly enjoyed:

- Machine Learning: experimented with various techniques, such as classifications and clustering. I also learned about neural networks and probabilistic models.
- Software engineering & design patterns: learning about the different methodologies for software development, and getting introduced to best practices to common problems by implementing design patterns.
