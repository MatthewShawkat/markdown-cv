<h2 id="profile">Profile</h2>
<p>I'm a passionate and dedicated web developer, with an interest in self-development and learning new things. My aim is to create robust and high quality systems, which are aesthetically pleasing and provide usable interfaces. I'm very flexible and adaptable to new technologies, which I enjoy experimenting with. I like to work on interesting challenges, and I am currently looking to join a dynamic and ambitious team.</p>

<p>I worked with a Scrum team developing a web framework that provides offline capabilities to the Salesforce platform. The framework is built on HTML5 and AngularJS; it runs on a desktop browser, as well as mobile phones as a hybrid app using Cordova. Some of the work I did included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structured the AngularJS app in a modular way, with asynchronous module loading (ADM) implemented in RequireJS. Also, I decoupled the core functionality of the automatic syncing and offline storage, by implementing it in native JavaScript, using CoffeScript to avoid common JavaScript pitfalls, and achieve code readability.</li>
<li>Introduced Ionic Framework that provides a mobile first user interface, with full AngularJS integration. I integrated the SASS pre-processor to provide power and modularity in terms of generating style sheets.</li>
<li>Used IndexedDB and WebSQL to store data on the browser while offline, and synchronise automatically when back online. In addition, I used Underscore to write robust and clean code.</li>
<li>Set up Grunt to orchestrate the build process and provide one click deployments. The process compiles CoffeeScript and Sass, lints the code, runs the Karma tests, then minifies and copies the assets to the build directory. Documentation is auto generated from the source code.</li>
<li>Used Bower to manage third party dependencies, alongside internal library dependencies by converting them to bower packages.</li>
<li>Utilised Git for source control, and implemented a collaboration mechanism similar to the open source community, using Bitbucket.</li>
</ul>

<p>I studied the basics of programming and diverse aspects of computing. Among the courses I studied, I particularly enjoyed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine Learning: experimented with various techniques, such as classifications and clustering. I also learned about neural networks and probabilistic models.</li>
<li>Software engineering &amp; design patterns: learning about the different methodologies for software development, and getting introduced to best practices to common problems by implementing design patterns.</li>
</ul>
