<p>I'm a passionate and dedicated web developer, with an interest in self-development and learning new technologies. I aim to create high quality systems, which are aesthetically pleasing with usable interfaces. I like to work on interesting challenges, and I am currently looking to join a dynamic and ambitious team.</p>

<p>I work on a web app that forecasts trends and sets a budget for online ads. The app is made for Google and is integrated to use their historical data. The app is based on AngularJS. Some of the work includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bootstrapping and designing the app from scratch. The structure is very modular. It makes use of services and directives for code reusability and separation of concerns.</li>
<li>Setting up a custom build script with Gulp. The process compiles and lints the code and compiles SASS to CSS, runs the tests, minifies the code, then injects the generated files to the main HTML file. The result is finally moved to the build directory, ready for deployment.</li>
<li>Integrating modern front-end tools, such as Bower to manage third party dependencies, Karma for unit tests and Protractor for E2E testing.</li>
<li>Using the Bootstrap framework with custom overrides, to allow for a consistent and efficient CSS structure.</li>
</ul>

<p>I worked with a Scrum team developing a web framework that provides offline capabilities to the Salesforce platform. The framework is built on HTML5 and AngularJS; it runs on a desktop browser, as well as mobile phones as a hybrid app using Cordova. Some of the work I did included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structured the AngularJS app in a modular way, with asynchronous module loading (AMD) implemented with RequireJS. Also, I decoupled the core functionality of the automatic syncing and offline storage, by implementing it in native JavaScript, using CoffeScript to avoid common JavaScript pitfalls, and achieve code readability.</li>
<li>Introduced Ionic Framework that provides a mobile first user interface, with full AngularJS integration. I integrated the SASS pre-processor to provide power and modularity in terms of generating style sheets.</li>
<li>Used IndexedDB and WebSQL to store data on the browser while offline, and synchronise automatically when back online. In addition, I used Underscore to write robust and clean code.</li>
</ul>

<p>I worked with multiple clients on a wide range of projects. I worked simultaneously on these projects and adopted a lean methodology, where I would go through multiple iterations with clients. Some of the projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imkei App:</strong> an HTML5 mobile payment app, which uses SMS and Email to facilitate payments for freelancers. I created the app by integrating with GoCardLess (payment gateway), and having a Django backend that interfaces with their API.</li>
<li><strong>TrueUp:</strong> redesigning the company website. The project involved creating a responsive Wordpress theme from scratch. I used Foundation Framework to provide the basis of a clean and modern interface. For styling, I used Sass to modularise the CSS and save time.</li>
<li><strong>MallorcaPlus App:</strong> an HTML5 app, for selling excursions in Mallorca. The front end utilises AngularJS to provide modularity. The app integrates with PayPal for receiving payments, and the Django backend has an admin area for ticket and event management. The interface is multilingual with English, Spanish and German.</li>

<p>I worked in a fast paced development environment to create and support applications for traders. Projects usually involved working with multiple teams in different countries. Some of my work included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing automated building to applications developed by my team. I used Maven to manage dependencies, run tests and handle packaging, and Jenkins for continuous integration and build monitoring. This change shortened the deployment cycle from two weeks to a few minutes.</li>
<li>Updating the UI for some applications to use XAML. I used this opportunity to undertake UX research to find out how to improve the interface. Using the results of the research, I redesigned the layout and added some design patterns, such as grids and modals.</li>
<li>Developing a matching engine to reconcile feeds received from third party companies with the data stored in the company database. I added an algorithm to detect the nearest match if an exact match is not found. This helped traders find mismatch issues more efficiently.</li>

<p>I worked with a small team on a highly specific management system for housing associations. The project involved porting a desktop app to modern web app, providing a SaaS platform for clients. Some of my work included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating the strategy for the front end of the web app. I designed and implemented a modular JavaScript app that uses a REST infrastructure. JQuery was used to provide a more ‘app-like’ look and feel.</li>
<li>Creating wireframes and high fidelity mock-ups to test some ideas. I went through iterations of small prototypes before development, avoiding the trap of committing to a design that does not match the clients’ expectations.</li>

<p>I worked with a core technical team developing libraries and infrastructure for other teams. The main focus was on developing a new section for an in-house web portal that aggregates feedback for research documents from multiple sources, filtering them according to specified rules and presenting them in the same format.</p>

<p>I studied the basics of programming and diverse aspects of computing. Among the courses I studied, I particularly enjoyed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Machine Learning: experimented with various techniques, such as classifications and clustering. I also learned about neural networks and probabilistic models.</li>
<li>Software engineering &amp; design patterns: learning about the different methodologies for software development, and getting introduced to best practices to common problems by implementing design patterns.</li>
